### Welcome to my profile!

### My pinned repositories host my favourite projects or the ones I am currently working on for my univeristy courses. Let me introduce them quickly:

 - HOUSE OF DESIGN (complete :heavy_check_mark: ): a website built for a fake exhibition that dynamically displays design objects and their data.
 - ACAXO (complete :heavy_check_mark: ): a study for mapping through an ontology the most common ideological patterns in abortion discourse on Twitter/X.
 - PANDAMIC (complete :heavy_check_mark: ): a project consisting of a python code file able to create graph and relational databases from a given dataset and to return objects based on a query.
