### Welcome to my profile!

### My pinned repositories host my favourite projects or the ones I am currently working on for my univeristy courses. Let me introduce them quickly:

 - HOUSE OF DESIGN (complete :heavy_check_mark: ): a website built for a mock exhibition that dynamically displays design objects and their data. For the objects, 3D models that weren't available online were manually created.
 - MULTIFFTCAT (complete ✔️ ): for the Machine Learning course project, I attempted to create a model for tackling the Hateful Memes Challenge launched by META in 2020, using data available on Hugging Face.
 - ACAXO (complete :heavy_check_mark: ): a study for mapping through an ontology the most common ideological patterns in abortion discourse on Twitter/X.
 - PANDAMIC (complete :heavy_check_mark: ): a project consisting of a python code file able to create graph and relational databases from a given dataset and to return objects based on a query.
 - PHARMACY SIDE EFFECTS (complete ✔️ ): a network analysis project consisting in the exploration of the graph through different metrics. The dataset shows the expected side effects associated with the concurrent use of different drugs.
