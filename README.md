# Welcome to my profile!

## My pinned repositories host the projects i am currently working on for my univeristy courses. Let me introduce them quickly:

### - ACAXO (complete): a study for mapping through an ontology the most common ideological patterns in abortion discourse on Twitter/X.
### - Pandamic (complete): a project consisting of a python code file able to create graph and relational databases from a given dataset and to return objects based on a query.
### - House of Design (incomplete): a website built for a fake exhibition that dynamically displays design objects and their data.
